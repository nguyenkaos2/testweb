``set`` Data Structure
----------------------

``set`` is a really useful data structure. ``sets`` behave mostly like
lists with the distinction that they can not contain duplicate values.
It is really useful in a lot of cases. For instance you might want to
check whether there are duplicates in a list or not. You have two
options. The first one involves using a ``for`` loop. Something like
this:

.. code:: python

    some_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'b', 'd', 'm', 'n', 'n']

    duplicates = []
    for value in some_list:
        if some_list.count(value) > 1:
            if value not in duplicates:
                duplicates.append(value)

    print(duplicates)
    # Output: ['b', 'n']

But there is a simpler and more elegant solution involving ``sets``. You
can simply do something like this:

.. code:: python

    some_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'b', 'd', 'm', 'n', 'n']
    duplicates = set([x for x in some_list if some_list.count(x) > 1])
    print(duplicates)
    # Output: set(['b', 'n'])

Sets also have a few other methods. Below are some of them.

**Intersection**

You can intersect two sets. For instance:

.. code:: python

    valid = set(['yellow', 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'black'])
    input_set = set(['red', 'brown'])
    print(input_set.intersection(valid))
    # Output: set(['red'])

**Difference**

You can find the invalid values in the above example using the
difference method. For example:

.. code:: python

    valid = set(['yellow', 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'black'])
    input_set = set(['red', 'brown'])
    print(input_set.difference(valid))
    # Output: set(['brown'])

You can also create sets using the new notation:

.. code:: python

    a_set = {'red', 'blue', 'green'}
    print(type(a_set))
    # Output: <type 'set'>

There are a few other methods as well. I would recommend visiting the
official documentation and giving it a quick read.
